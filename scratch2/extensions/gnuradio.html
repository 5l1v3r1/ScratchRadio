<h1>About Scratch Radio</h1>

<p>Scratch Radio is intended to introduce new users to some of the basic concepts
behind Software Defined Radio, using the Scratch visual programming environment
on the Raspberry Pi as the development platform. It uses GNU Radio and the
<a href="https://wiki.myriadrf.org/LimeSDR-Mini">LimeSDR-Mini</a> USB adapter
to provide the underlying radio implementation and since this is loosely coupled
to the Scratch Radio frontend the same radio implementation could also be
adapted to other environments.</p>

<p>Full documentation for the Scratch Radio extension can be found on the
MyriadRF <a href="https://wiki.myriadrf.org/ScratchRadio">Scratch Radio Wiki</a>.</p>
